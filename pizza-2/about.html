                <div class="about-p">
                    <p>Established before the dawn of time, Da' Bomb Slice Pizzeria started out by performing thorough
                        research by spending many moons ordering pizzas from a variety of companies around the valley.
                        Each time we felt like we found the best place to order a pizza, disappointment would arise. It
                        seemed all hope was lost in finding the most BOMB place to order the pizza our cravings were
                        calling for.</p>
                </div>
                <p>After being let down one too many times, we decided to take matters into our owns
                    hands and make a pizza experience like no other. A true build your own pie platform that allows our
                    customers to get what they want. Want a fully loaded nacho style pie that's toasted to
                    perfection? You got it. Heck, if you want to giddy up with southwestern ingredients and
                    have your pie smoked until it's black on the edges? It will be done. </p>

                <p>Point is... we like options and when no one else had the options to match our creativity, we took
                    action. Because of this we are confident that our customers will be happy with their experience and
                    hungry to order more that makes them yell "this pizza is da' BOMB!!"</p>
