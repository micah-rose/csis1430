<!--
1) <div> tag helps separate html page into separate sections (block display)
2) the class attribute allows to name a tag to make for easier stying in CSS
3) <span> tag is known as inline, it stays in line with its paragraph
4) ID are targeted in CSS with # symbol - ID trumps class, it is more specific
** use class attribute for CSS, for JavaScript use ID
5) the display property: can be block, inline, inline-block, flex, grid, etc.
** default display is block for most things
