	<h1>Europe - The Final Countdown</h1>
	<img id="euro-pic" src="img/europe1.jpg" onclick="pictureSwap();">
	<p>Europe is a Swedish rock band formed in Upplands Väsby in 1979,[5] by vocalist Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum,
		bass guitarist Peter Olsson, and drummer Tony Reno.</p>
	<p>They got a major breakthrough in Sweden in 1982 by winning the televised competition "Rock-SM" (Swedish Rock
		Championships) It was the first time this competition was held, and Europe became a larger success than the
		competition itself.</p>
	<p>Since their formation Europe has released eleven studio albums, three live albums, three compilations and nineteen
		music videos. Europe rose to international fame in the 1980s with their third album, 1986's The Final Countdown,
		which has sold over 3 million copies in the United States and 15 million copies worldwide (including album and
		single). Europe have sold over 25 million records worldwide.</p>
