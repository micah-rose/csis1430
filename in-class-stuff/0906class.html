<!-- <map> tag is like a placeholder for other tags. You will have an open and
    closed map tag with a bunch of <area> tags inside of it. <area> tags include
attributes such as href, shape, and coords. To map an image you can give the map
a name (<map name = "dio") and then call the map in your image (<img usemap="#dio") -->
