CSS Grids

- not supported in all browsers yet, it is fairly new
- track refers to both rows and columns
- grid gap is a gap between the rows that separate the columns and rows
- use "display: grid" instead of "display: block"

grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 25% 25% (creates 4 columns at 25% size)
grid-column-gap: 10px
grid-row-gap: 10px
grid-gap: 10px (does both column and row)

1fr = 1 fraction (fraction of the width of the div)
2fr = 2 fractions (twice as big)
- can use decimals with fractions
- goes with grid-template-columns:
- repeat(5, 1fr) (repeats 1fr 5 times)

grid-auto-rows: 200px (automatically sets rows to 200px)
grid-auto-rows: minmax(400px, auto) (can be used to readjust divs text size)
grid-template-rows: repeat(3, minmax(400px, auto))

nth-child(1) = first child
nth-child(5) = fifth child 

grid-column: 1/3 (sets div to go from line 1 to line 3)
grid-row: 5/7 (sets div to go from line 5 to line 7)

- you can put grids inside other divs (so a grid within a grid)

grid-area: name
grid-template-area: 
"name name name name"
"aside main main main"
"nav main main main"
"section section section section"
"footer footer footer footer";
- make sure to assign columns and rows prior to using area feature
