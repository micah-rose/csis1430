                    <p>Eurypterids, often informally referred to as sea scorpions, are an extinct group of arthropods
                        that form the order Eurypterida. The earliest known eurypterids date to the Darriwilian stage
                        of the Ordovician period 467.3 million years ago, though the group is likely to have first
                        appeared either during the Early Ordovician or Late Cambrian period. The Eurypterida is the
                        most diverse Paleozoic chelicerate order in terms of species, containing approximately 250
                        species.</p>

                    <p>Although popularly called "sea scorpions", only the earliest eurypterids were marine, with many
                        later forms living in brackish or fresh water, and they were not true scorpions. Some studies
                        suggest that a dual respiratory system was present, which would have allowed for short periods
                        of time in terrestrial environments. The name Eurypterida comes from the Ancient Greek words
                        εὐρύς (eurús), meaning "broad" or "wide", and πτερόν (pteron), meaning "wing", referring to the
                        pair of wide swimming appendages present in many members of the group.</p>

                        like their larger relatives and sizes around 100 centimeters (3.3 ft) are common in most
                        eurypterid groups. The smallest eurypterids, Alkenopterus burglahrensis and Eocarcinosoma
                        batrachophthalmus, measured just 3 centimeters (1.2in) in length whilst the largest exceeded 2
