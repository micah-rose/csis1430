      <p>
        I am majoring in software development and web programming. In addition
        to my studies here at SLCC, I am also taking additional online courses
        through Udemy and Pluralsight. I have found that out of the two, I favor
        using the tools and resources available to me through Pluralsight. One
        day I would hope to work for Pluralsight as a JavaScript developer. I am
        finishing up Fall Semester 2018 and will graduate during Summer Semester
        2019.

            Understanding best practices - understanding the importance of
            writing code one step at a time and also testing your code
            throughout writing it to ensure functionality to achieve the end
            result. This has not only benefited me in the classroom setting, but
            also in my day to day as a SQL report developer. I have found that I
            am able to be more consistent with the code I write and am more
            knowledgeable about the purpose for each line of code. I have been
            able to apply these practices to SQL, Java, and JavaScript.

            Learnerâ€™s mindset - taking CSIS 1550 was really the trigger for my
            drive to become a software developer. SQL was the first programming
            language I was introduced to; so learning SQL and then introducing
            Java into my curriculum, I was able to adapt concepts from each
            language to help build a strong foundation for programming. It has
            also sparked an eagerness to learn additional programming languages
            and has been a big motivator in adjusting my degree program to
            include web development.

            Thinking outside the box - being someone who thinks very literally,
            all my life I have felt it was a weakness or disadvantage. Learning
            SQL and Java has made me realize that it is, in fact, a strength and
            can help me look at concepts or problems in a more simpler way and
            avoid overthinking them. Utilizing my natural way of thinking as a
            strength has improved my communication skills in contributing to
            constructive conversation with peers and having more confidence to
            share innovative ideas.
